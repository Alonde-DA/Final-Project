# Final-Project

The project is part of the UN Sustainable Development Goals

I chose three key social indicators that are part of the Goals:

-Quality Education

-Good Health

-Well-being and Gender Equality

 

The question I tried to answer is:

"How does education impact the fertility rates and life expectancy of women"

The objective was:

"Explore whether regions with higher education level for women experience lower fertility rates and increased life expectancy"

 

The analysis started by loading three different datasets into Python:

-Fertility rate (births per woman)

-Life Expectancy at birth (years)

-Literacy Rate %-Female (15yrs+)

 

The data was cleaned. The correlation between life expectancy and fertility rate was explored. The analysis performed suggests a negative correlation between the two data sets.

 

The three data sets were then combined and exported to Tableau for further analysis and visualisation.

 

Ultimately, the data shows that countries with higher literacy rates tend to lower fertility rates and a higher life expectancy.

 

The results could be used to aid policy making on national and regional level. It could also support decision making when it comes to distribution and allocation of funding.

 

Further analysis can be performed to include other key indicators such as GDP and/or health services provision levels.
